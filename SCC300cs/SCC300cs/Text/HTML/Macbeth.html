<h3><b>SCENE II. A Camp near Forres.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc"> Alarum within. Enter <span class="charname">King Duncan,
Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox,</span> with Attendants, meeting a bleeding
<span class="charname">Captain</span>.</p>


<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
What bloody man is that? He can report,<br/>
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt<br/>
The newest state.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
This is the sergeant<br/>
Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought<br/>
&rsquo;Gainst my captivity.&mdash;Hail, brave friend!<br/>
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil<br/>
As thou didst leave it.
</p>

<p>SOLDIER.<br/>
Doubtful it stood;<br/>
As two spent swimmers that do cling together<br/>
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald<br/>
(Worthy to be a rebel, for to that<br/>
The multiplying villainies of nature<br/>
Do swarm upon him) from the Western Isles<br/>
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;<br/>
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,<br/>
Show&rsquo;d like a rebel&rsquo;s whore. But all&rsquo;s too weak;<br/>
For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),<br/>
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish&rsquo;d steel,<br/>
Which smok&rsquo;d with bloody execution,<br/>
Like Valour&rsquo;s minion, carv&rsquo;d out his passage,<br/>
Till he fac&rsquo;d the slave;<br/>
Which ne&rsquo;er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,<br/>
Till he unseam&rsquo;d him from the nave to the chops,<br/>
And fix&rsquo;d his head upon our battlements.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
</p>

<p>SOLDIER.<br/>
As whence the sun &rsquo;gins his reflection<br/>
Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break,<br/>
So from that spring, whence comfort seem&rsquo;d to come<br/>
Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark:<br/>
No sooner justice had, with valour arm&rsquo;d,<br/>
Compell&rsquo;d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,<br/>
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,<br/>
With furbish&rsquo;d arms and new supplies of men,<br/>
Began a fresh assault.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
Dismay&rsquo;d not this<br/>
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
</p>

<p>SOLDIER.<br/>
Yes;<br/>
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.<br/>
If I say sooth, I must report they were<br/>
As cannons overcharg&rsquo;d with double cracks;<br/>
So they<br/>
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:<br/>
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,<br/>
Or memorize another Golgotha,<br/>
I cannot tell&mdash;<br/>
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:<br/>
They smack of honour both.&mdash;Go, get him surgeons.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Captain,</span> attended.</i>]</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Ross</span> and
<span class="charname">Angus</span>.</p>

<p>
Who comes here?
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
The worthy Thane of Ross.
</p>

<p>LENNOX.<br/>
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look<br/>
That seems to speak things strange.
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
God save the King!
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
Whence cam&rsquo;st thou, worthy thane?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
From Fife, great King,<br/>
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky<br/>
And fan our people cold.<br/>
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,<br/>
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,<br/>
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;<br/>
Till that Bellona&rsquo;s bridegroom, lapp&rsquo;d in proof,<br/>
Confronted him with self-comparisons,<br/>
Point against point, rebellious arm &rsquo;gainst arm,<br/>
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,<br/>
The victory fell on us.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
Great happiness!
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
That now<br/>
Sweno, the Norways&rsquo; king, craves composition;<br/>
Nor would we deign him burial of his men<br/>
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme&rsquo;s Inch<br/>
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive<br/>
Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,<br/>
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll see it done.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.

<h3><b>SCENE III. A heath.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc"> Thunder. Enter the three <span class="charname">Witches</span>.</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
Where hast thou been, sister?
</p>

<p>SECOND WITCH.<br/>
Killing swine.
</p>

<p>THIRD WITCH.<br/>
Sister, where thou?
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
A sailor&rsquo;s wife had chestnuts in her lap,<br/>
And mounch&rsquo;d, and mounch&rsquo;d, and mounch&rsquo;d. &ldquo;Give
me,&rdquo; quoth I.<br/>
&ldquo;Aroint thee, witch!&rdquo; the rump-fed ronyon cries.<br/>
Her husband&rsquo;s to Aleppo gone, master o&rsquo; th&rsquo; <i>Tiger:</i><br/>
But in a sieve I&rsquo;ll thither sail,<br/>
And, like a rat without a tail,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll do, I&rsquo;ll do, and I&rsquo;ll do.
</p>

<p>SECOND WITCH.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll give thee a wind.
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
Th&rsquo;art kind.
</p>

<p>THIRD WITCH.<br/>
And I another.
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
I myself have all the other,<br/>
And the very ports they blow,<br/>
All the quarters that they know<br/>
I&rsquo; the shipman&rsquo;s card.<br/>
I will drain him dry as hay:<br/>
Sleep shall neither night nor day<br/>
Hang upon his pent-house lid;<br/>
He shall live a man forbid.<br/>
Weary sev&rsquo;n-nights nine times nine,<br/>
Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine:<br/>
Though his bark cannot be lost,<br/>
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.<br/>
Look what I have.
</p>

<p>SECOND WITCH.<br/>
Show me, show me.
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
Here I have a pilot&rsquo;s thumb,<br/>
Wrack&rsquo;d as homeward he did come.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Drum within.</i>]</p>

<p>THIRD WITCH.<br/>
A drum, a drum!<br/>
Macbeth doth come.
</p>

<p>ALL.<br/>
The Weird Sisters, hand in hand,<br/>
Posters of the sea and land,<br/>
Thus do go about, about:<br/>
Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,<br/>
And thrice again, to make up nine.<br/>
Peace!&mdash;the charm&rsquo;s wound up.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Macbeth</span> and
<span class="charname">Banquo</span>.</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
How far is&rsquo;t call&rsquo;d to Forres?&mdash;What are these,<br/>
So wither&rsquo;d, and so wild in their attire,<br/>
That look not like the inhabitants o&rsquo; th&rsquo; earth,<br/>
And yet are on&rsquo;t?&mdash;Live you? or are you aught<br/>
That man may question? You seem to understand me,<br/>
By each at once her choppy finger laying<br/>
Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,<br/>
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret<br/>
That you are so.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Speak, if you can;&mdash;what are you?
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!
</p>

<p>SECOND WITCH.<br/>
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!
</p>

<p>THIRD WITCH.<br/>
All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
Good sir, why do you start and seem to fear<br/>
Things that do sound so fair?&mdash;I&rsquo; th&rsquo; name of truth,<br/>
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed<br/>
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner<br/>
You greet with present grace and great prediction<br/>
Of noble having and of royal hope,<br/>
That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.<br/>
If you can look into the seeds of time,<br/>
And say which grain will grow, and which will not,<br/>
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear<br/>
Your favours nor your hate.
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
Hail!
</p>

<p>SECOND WITCH.<br/>
Hail!
</p>

<p>THIRD WITCH.<br/>
Hail!
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
</p>

<p>SECOND WITCH.<br/>
Not so happy, yet much happier.
</p>

<p>THIRD WITCH.<br/>
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:<br/>
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
</p>

<p>FIRST WITCH.<br/>
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.<br/>
By Sinel&rsquo;s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;<br/>
But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,<br/>
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king<br/>
Stands not within the prospect of belief,<br/>
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence<br/>
You owe this strange intelligence? or why<br/>
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way<br/>
With such prophetic greeting?&mdash;Speak, I charge you.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i><span class="charname">Witches</span> vanish.</i>]</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,<br/>
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish&rsquo;d?
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Into the air; and what seem&rsquo;d corporal,<br/>
Melted as breath into the wind.<br/>
Would they had stay&rsquo;d!
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
Were such things here as we do speak about?<br/>
Or have we eaten on the insane root<br/>
That takes the reason prisoner?
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Your children shall be kings.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
You shall be king.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
And Thane of Cawdor too; went it not so?
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
To the selfsame tune and words. Who&rsquo;s here?
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Ross</span> and
<span class="charname">Angus</span>.</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
The King hath happily receiv&rsquo;d, Macbeth,<br/>
The news of thy success, and when he reads<br/>
Thy personal venture in the rebels&rsquo; fight,<br/>
His wonders and his praises do contend<br/>
Which should be thine or his: silenc&rsquo;d with that,<br/>
In viewing o&rsquo;er the rest o&rsquo; th&rsquo; selfsame day,<br/>
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,<br/>
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,<br/>
Strange images of death. As thick as tale<br/>
Came post with post; and everyone did bear<br/>
Thy praises in his kingdom&rsquo;s great defence,<br/>
And pour&rsquo;d them down before him.
</p>

<p>ANGUS.<br/>
We are sent<br/>
To give thee from our royal master thanks;<br/>
Only to herald thee into his sight,<br/>
Not pay thee.
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,<br/>
He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor:<br/>
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane,<br/>
For it is thine.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
What, can the devil speak true?
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
The Thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me<br/>
In borrow&rsquo;d robes?
</p>

<p>ANGUS.<br/>
Who was the Thane lives yet,<br/>
But under heavy judgement bears that life<br/>
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combin&rsquo;d<br/>
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel<br/>
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both<br/>
He labour&rsquo;d in his country&rsquo;s wrack, I know not;<br/>
But treasons capital, confess&rsquo;d and prov&rsquo;d,<br/>
Have overthrown him.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor:<br/>
The greatest is behind. [<i>To Ross and Angus.</i>] Thanks for your pains.<br/>
[<i>To Banquo.</i>] Do you not hope your children shall be kings,<br/>
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me<br/>
Promis&rsquo;d no less to them?
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
That, trusted home,<br/>
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,<br/>
Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But &rsquo;tis strange:<br/>
And oftentimes to win us to our harm,<br/>
The instruments of darkness tell us truths;<br/>
Win us with honest trifles, to betray&rsquo;s<br/>
In deepest consequence.&mdash;<br/>
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Two truths are told,<br/>
As happy prologues to the swelling act<br/>
Of the imperial theme.&mdash;I thank you, gentlemen.&mdash;<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] This supernatural soliciting<br/>
Cannot be ill; cannot be good. If ill,<br/>
Why hath it given me earnest of success,<br/>
Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor:<br/>
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion<br/>
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair,<br/>
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,<br/>
Against the use of nature? Present fears<br/>
Are less than horrible imaginings.<br/>
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,<br/>
Shakes so my single state of man<br/>
That function is smother&rsquo;d in surmise,<br/>
And nothing is but what is not.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
Look, how our partner&rsquo;s rapt.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me<br/>
Without my stir.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
New honours come upon him,<br/>
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould<br/>
But with the aid of use.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] Come what come may,<br/>
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Give me your favour. My dull brain was wrought<br/>
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains<br/>
Are register&rsquo;d where every day I turn<br/>
The leaf to read them.&mdash;Let us toward the King.&mdash;<br/>
Think upon what hath chanc&rsquo;d; and at more time,<br/>
The interim having weigh&rsquo;d it, let us speak<br/>
Our free hearts each to other.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
Very gladly.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Till then, enough.&mdash;Come, friends.

In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness&rsquo; part<br/>
Is to receive our duties: and our duties<br/>
Are to your throne and state, children and servants;<br/>
Which do but what they should, by doing everything<br/>
Safe toward your love and honour.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
Welcome hither:<br/>
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour<br/>
To make thee full of growing.&mdash;Noble Banquo,<br/>
That hast no less deserv&rsquo;d, nor must be known<br/>
No less to have done so, let me infold thee<br/>
And hold thee to my heart.
</p>

<p>BANQUO.<br/>
There if I grow,<br/>
The harvest is your own.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
My plenteous joys,<br/>
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves<br/>
In drops of sorrow.&mdash;Sons, kinsmen, thanes,<br/>
And you whose places are the nearest, know,<br/>
We will establish our estate upon<br/>
Our eldest, Malcolm; whom we name hereafter<br/>
The Prince of Cumberland: which honour must<br/>
Not unaccompanied invest him only,<br/>
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine<br/>
On all deservers.&mdash;From hence to Inverness,<br/>
And bind us further to you.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
The rest is labour, which is not us&rsquo;d for you:<br/>
I&rsquo;ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful<br/>
The hearing of my wife with your approach;<br/>
So, humbly take my leave.
</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
My worthy Cawdor!
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
[<i>Aside.</i>] The Prince of Cumberland!&mdash;That is a step<br/>
On which I must fall down, or else o&rsquo;erleap,<br/>
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires!<br/>
Let not light see my black and deep desires.<br/>
The eye wink at the hand, yet let that be,<br/>
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>DUNCAN.<br/>
True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant;<br/>
And in his commendations I am fed.<br/>
It is a banquet to me. Let&rsquo;s after him,<br/>
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:<br/>
It is a peerless kinsman.

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
&ldquo;They met me in the day of success; and I have learned by the
perfect&rsquo;st report they have more in them than mortal knowledge. When I
burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into which
they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the
King, who all-hailed me, &lsquo;Thane of Cawdor&rsquo;; by which title, before,
these Weird Sisters saluted me, and referred me to the coming on of time, with
&lsquo;Hail, king that shalt be!&rsquo; This have I thought good to deliver
thee (my dearest partner of greatness) that thou might&rsquo;st not lose the
dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promis&rsquo;d thee.
Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be<br/>
What thou art promis&rsquo;d. Yet do I fear thy nature;<br/>
It is too full o&rsquo; th&rsquo; milk of human kindness<br/>
To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great;<br/>
Art not without ambition, but without<br/>
The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,<br/>
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,<br/>
And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou&rsquo;dst have, great Glamis,<br/>
That which cries, &ldquo;Thus thou must do,&rdquo; if thou have it;<br/>
And that which rather thou dost fear to do,<br/>
Than wishest should be undone. Hie thee hither,<br/>
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,<br/>
And chastise with the valour of my tongue<br/>
All that impedes thee from the golden round,<br/>
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem<br/>
To have thee crown&rsquo;d withal.

So please you, it is true. Our thane is coming.<br/>

We cours&rsquo;d him at the heels, and had a purpose<br/>
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;<br/>

To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,<br/>
We are your guest tonight.

If it were done when &rsquo;tis done, then &rsquo;twere well<br/>

To plague th&rsquo; inventor. This even-handed justice<br/>
Commends th&rsquo; ingredience of our poison&rsquo;d chalice<br/>
To our own lips. He&rsquo;s here in double trust:<br/>
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,<br/>
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,<br/>
Who should against his murderer shut the door,<br/>
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan<br/>
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been<br/>

He hath honour&rsquo;d me of late; and I have bought<br/>
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,<br/>
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,<br/>
Not cast aside so soon.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Was the hope drunk<br/>
Wherein you dress&rsquo;d yourself? Hath it slept since?<br/>
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale<br/>
At what it did so freely? From this time<br/>
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard<br/>
To be the same in thine own act and valour<br/>
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that<br/>
Which thou esteem&rsquo;st the ornament of life,<br/>
And live a coward in thine own esteem,<br/>
Letting &ldquo;I dare not&rdquo; wait upon &ldquo;I would,&rdquo;<br/>

Pr&rsquo;ythee, peace!<br/>
I dare do all that may become a man;<br/>
Who dares do more is none.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
What beast was&rsquo;t, then,<br/>
That made you break this enterprise to me?<br/>
When you durst do it, then you were a man;<br/>
And, to be more than what you were, you would<br/>
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place<br/>
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:<br/>
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now<br/>
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know<br/>
How tender &rsquo;tis to love the babe that milks me:<br/>
I would, while it was smiling in my face,<br/>
Have pluck&rsquo;d my nipple from his boneless gums<br/>
And dash&rsquo;d the brains out, had I so sworn as you<br/>
Have done to this.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
If we should fail?
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
We fail?<br/>
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,<br/>
And we&rsquo;ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep<br/>
(Whereto the rather shall his day&rsquo;s hard journey<br/>
Soundly invite him), his two chamberlains<br/>
Will I with wine and wassail so convince<br/>
That memory, the warder of the brain,<br/>
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason<br/>
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep<br/>
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,<br/>
What cannot you and I perform upon<br/>
Th&rsquo; unguarded Duncan? what not put upon<br/>
His spongy officers; who shall bear the guilt<br/>
Of our great quell?
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Bring forth men-children only;<br/>
For thy undaunted mettle should compose<br/>
Nothing but males. Will it not be receiv&rsquo;d,<br/>
When we have mark&rsquo;d with blood those sleepy two<br/>
Of his own chamber, and us&rsquo;d their very daggers,<br/>
That they have done&rsquo;t?
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Who dares receive it other,<br/>
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar<br/>
Upon his death?
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
I am settled, and bend up<br/>
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.<br/>
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:<br/>
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

There&rsquo;s one did laugh in&rsquo;s sleep, and one cried,

Again to sleep.

Sleep that knits up the ravell&rsquo;d sleave of care,<br/>
The death of each day&rsquo;s life, sore labour&rsquo;s bath,<br/>
Balm of hurt minds, great nature&rsquo;s second course,<br/>
Chief nourisher in life&rsquo;s feast.

Still it cried, &ldquo;Sleep no more!&rdquo; to all the house:<br/>

Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more!&rdquo;

You do unbend your noble strength to think<br/>
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,<br/>
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.&mdash;<br/>
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?<br/>
They must lie there: go carry them, and smear<br/>
The sleepy grooms with blood.

Look on&rsquo;t again I dare not.

Infirm of purpose!<br/>
Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead<br/>
Are but as pictures. &rsquo;Tis the eye of childhood<br/>

Here&rsquo;s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should
have old turning the key. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock, knock. Who&rsquo;s
there, i&rsquo; th&rsquo; name of Belzebub? Here&rsquo;s a farmer that hanged
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in time; have napkins enow about
you; here you&rsquo;ll sweat for&rsquo;t. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock!
Who&rsquo;s there, i&rsquo; th&rsquo; other devil&rsquo;s name? Faith,
here&rsquo;s an equivocator, that could swear in both the scales against either
scale, who committed treason enough for God&rsquo;s sake, yet could not
equivocate to heaven: O, come in, equivocator. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock,
knock! Who&rsquo;s there? Faith, here&rsquo;s an English tailor come hither,
for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your
goose. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?&mdash;But
this place is too cold for hell. I&rsquo;ll devil-porter it no further: I had
thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to
th&rsquo; everlasting bonfire. [<i>Knocking.</i>] Anon, anon! I pray you,
remember the porter.

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,<br/>
That you do lie so late?
</p>

<p>PORTER.<br/>
Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great
provoker of three things.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
What three things does drink especially provoke?
</p>

<p>PORTER.<br/>
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and
unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance.
Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes
him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion,
equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
</p>

<p>PORTER.<br/>
That it did, sir, i&rsquo; the very throat on me; but I requited him for his
lie; and (I think) being too strong for him, though he took up my legs
sometime, yet I made a shift to cast him.

Lamentings heard i&rsquo; th&rsquo; air, strange screams of death,<br/>
And prophesying, with accents terrible,<br/>
Of dire combustion and confus&rsquo;d events,<br/>
New hatch&rsquo;d to the woeful time. The obscure bird<br/>

Was feverous, and did shake.

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
O, by whom?
</p>

<p>LENNOX.<br/>
Those of his chamber, as it seem&rsquo;d, had done&rsquo;t:<br/>
Their hands and faces were all badg&rsquo;d with blood;<br/>
So were their daggers, which, unwip&rsquo;d, we found<br/>
Upon their pillows. They star&rsquo;d, and were distracted;<br/>
No man&rsquo;s life was to be trusted with them.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
O, yet I do repent me of my fury,<br/>
That I did kill them.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Wherefore did you so?
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Who can be wise, amaz&rsquo;d, temperate, and furious,<br/>
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:<br/>
Th&rsquo; expedition of my violent love<br/>
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,<br/>
His silver skin lac&rsquo;d with his golden blood;<br/>
And his gash&rsquo;d stabs look&rsquo;d like a breach in nature<br/>
For ruin&rsquo;s wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,<br/>
Steep&rsquo;d in the colours of their trade, their daggers<br/>
Unmannerly breech&rsquo;d with gore. Who could refrain,<br/>
That had a heart to love, and in that heart<br/>
Courage to make&rsquo;s love known?
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Help me hence, ho!

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Why do we hold our tongues,<br/>

Ha, good father,<br/>
Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man&rsquo;s act,<br/>

That darkness does the face of earth entomb,<br/>
When living light should kiss it?
</p>

<p>OLD MAN.<br/>
&rsquo;Tis unnatural,<br/>
Even like the deed that&rsquo;s done. On Tuesday last,<br/>
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,<br/>
Was by a mousing owl hawk&rsquo;d at and kill&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
And Duncan&rsquo;s horses (a thing most strange and certain)<br/>
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,<br/>
Turn&rsquo;d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,<br/>
Contending &rsquo;gainst obedience, as they would make<br/>
War with mankind.

<p>FIRST MURDERER.<br/>
It was, so please your Highness.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Well then, now<br/>
Have you consider&rsquo;d of my speeches? Know<br/>
That it was he, in the times past, which held you<br/>
So under fortune, which you thought had been<br/>
Our innocent self? This I made good to you<br/>
In our last conference, pass&rsquo;d in probation with you<br/>
How you were borne in hand, how cross&rsquo;d, the instruments,<br/>
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might<br/>
To half a soul and to a notion craz&rsquo;d<br/>
Say, &ldquo;Thus did Banquo.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>FIRST MURDERER.<br/>
You made it known to us.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
I did so; and went further, which is now<br/>
Our point of second meeting. Do you find<br/>
Your patience so predominant in your nature,<br/>
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell&rsquo;d,<br/>
To pray for this good man and for his issue,<br/>
Whose heavy hand hath bow&rsquo;d you to the grave,<br/>
And beggar&rsquo;d yours forever?
</p>

<p>FIRST MURDERER.<br/>
We are men, my liege.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;<br/>
As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,<br/>
Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves are clept<br/>
All by the name of dogs: the valu&rsquo;d file<br/>
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,<br/>
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one<br/>
According to the gift which bounteous nature<br/>
Hath in him clos&rsquo;d; whereby he does receive<br/>
Particular addition, from the bill<br/>
That writes them all alike: and so of men.<br/>
Now, if you have a station in the file,<br/>
Not i&rsquo; th&rsquo; worst rank of manhood, say&rsquo;t;<br/>
And I will put that business in your bosoms,<br/>
Whose execution takes your enemy off,<br/>
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,<br/>
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,<br/>
Which in his death were perfect.
</p>

<p>SECOND MURDERER.<br/>
I am one, my liege,<br/>
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world<br/>
Hath so incens&rsquo;d that I am reckless what<br/>
I do to spite the world.
</p>

<p>FIRST MURDERER.<br/>
And I another,<br/>
So weary with disasters, tugg&rsquo;d with fortune,<br/>
That I would set my life on any chance,<br/>
To mend it or be rid on&rsquo;t.

Both of you<br/>
Know Banquo was your enemy.

True, my lord.

So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,<br/>
That every minute of his being thrusts<br/>
Against my near&rsquo;st of life; and though I could<br/>
With barefac&rsquo;d power sweep him from my sight,<br/>
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,<br/>
For certain friends that are both his and mine,<br/>
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall<br/>
Who I myself struck down: and thence it is<br/>
That I to your assistance do make love,<br/>
Masking the business from the common eye<br/>
For sundry weighty reasons.
</p>

<p>SECOND MURDERER.<br/>
We shall, my lord,<br/>
Perform what you command us.
</p>

<p>FIRST MURDERER.<br/>
Though our lives&mdash;

I will advise you where to plant yourselves,<br/>
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o&rsquo; th&rsquo; time,<br/>
The moment on&rsquo;t; for&rsquo;t must be done tonight<br/>
And something from the palace; always thought<br/>
That I require a clearness. And with him<br/>
(To leave no rubs nor botches in the work)<br/>
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,<br/>
Whose absence is no less material to me<br/>
Than is his father&rsquo;s, must embrace the fate<br/>
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll come to you anon.
</p>

<p>BOTH MURDERERS.<br/>

Say to the King, I would attend his leisure<br/>
For a few words.
</p>

<p>SERVANT.<br/>
Madam, I will.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Naught&rsquo;s had, all&rsquo;s spent,<br/>
Where our desire is got without content:<br/>
&rsquo;Tis safer to be that which we destroy,<br/>
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Macbeth</span>.</p>

<p>How now, my lord, why do you keep alone,<br/>
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,<br/>
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died<br/>
With them they think on? Things without all remedy<br/>
Should be without regard: what&rsquo;s done is done.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
We have scorch&rsquo;d the snake, not kill&rsquo;d it.<br/>
She&rsquo;ll close, and be herself; whilst our poor malice<br/>
Remains in danger of her former tooth.<br/>
But let the frame of things disjoint,<br/>
Both the worlds suffer,<br/>
Ere we will eat our meal in fear, and sleep<br/>
In the affliction of these terrible dreams<br/>
That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,<br/>
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,<br/>
Than on the torture of the mind to lie<br/>
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;<br/>
After life&rsquo;s fitful fever he sleeps well;<br/>
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,<br/>
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing<br/>
Can touch him further.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Come on,<br/>
Gently my lord, sleek o&rsquo;er your rugged looks;<br/>
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you.<br/>
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;<br/>
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:<br/>
Unsafe the while, that we<br/>
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,<br/>
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,<br/>
Disguising what they are.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
You must leave this.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!<br/>
Thou know&rsquo;st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
But in them nature&rsquo;s copy&rsquo;s not eterne.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
There&rsquo;s comfort yet; they are assailable.<br/>
Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown<br/>
His cloister&rsquo;d flight, ere to black Hecate&rsquo;s summons<br/>
The shard-born beetle, with his drowsy hums,<br/>
Hath rung night&rsquo;s yawning peal, there shall be done<br/>
A deed of dreadful note.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
What&rsquo;s to be done?
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,<br/>
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,<br/>
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,<br/>
And with thy bloody and invisible hand<br/>
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond<br/>
Which keeps me pale!&mdash;Light thickens; and the crow<br/>
Makes wing to th&rsquo; rooky wood.<br/>
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,<br/>
Whiles night&rsquo;s black agents to their preys do rouse.<br/>
Thou marvell&rsquo;st at my words: but hold thee still;<br/>
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.<br/>
So, pr&rsquo;ythee, go with me.

My lord, his throat is cut. That I did for him.

Thou art the best o&rsquo; th&rsquo; cut-throats;<br/>

Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,<br/>
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;<br/>
The least a death to nature.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Thanks for that.<br/>
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that&rsquo;s fled<br/>
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,<br/>
No teeth for th&rsquo; present.&mdash;Get thee gone; tomorrow<br/>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Sit, worthy friends. My lord is often thus,<br/>
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;<br/>
The fit is momentary; upon a thought<br/>
He will again be well. If much you note him,<br/>
You shall offend him, and extend his passion.<br/>
Feed, and regard him not.&mdash;Are you a man?

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that<br/>
Which might appal the devil.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
O proper stuff!<br/>
This is the very painting of your fear:<br/>
This is the air-drawn dagger which you said,<br/>
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws, and starts<br/>
(Impostors to true fear), would well become<br/>
A woman&rsquo;s story at a winter&rsquo;s fire,<br/>
Authoris&rsquo;d by her grandam. Shame itself!<br/>
Why do you make such faces? When all&rsquo;s done,<br/>
You look but on a stool.

Pr&rsquo;ythee, see there!<br/>
Behold! look! lo! how say you?<br/>
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.&mdash;<br/>

Those that we bury back, our monuments<br/>
Shall be the maws of kites.

Blood hath been shed ere now, i&rsquo; th&rsquo; olden time,<br/>
Ere humane statute purg&rsquo;d the gentle weal;<br/>
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform&rsquo;d<br/>
Too terrible for the ear: the time has been,<br/>
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,<br/>
And there an end; but now they rise again,<br/>
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,<br/>
And push us from our stools. This is more strange<br/>
Than such a murder is.

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
My worthy lord,<br/>
Your noble friends do lack you.

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
I do forget.&mdash;<br/>
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.<br/>

To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;<br/>
Then I&rsquo;ll sit down.&mdash;Give me some wine, fill full.&mdash;<br/>

Thou hast no speculation in those eyes<br/>
Which thou dost glare with!

The arm&rsquo;d rhinoceros, or th&rsquo; Hyrcan tiger;<br/>
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves<br/>
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,<br/>
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;<br/>
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me<br/>
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!<br/>
Unreal mock&rsquo;ry, hence!

With most admir&rsquo;d disorder.

Can such things be,<br/>
And overcome us like a summer&rsquo;s cloud,<br/>
Without our special wonder? You make me strange<br/>
Even to the disposition that I owe,<br/>
When now I think you can behold such sights,<br/>
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,<br/>
When mine are blanch&rsquo;d with fear.

By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,<br/>
All causes shall give way: I am in blood<br/>

My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,<br/>
Which can interpret farther: only, I say,<br/>
Thing&rsquo;s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan<br/>
Was pitied of Macbeth:&mdash;marry, he was dead:&mdash;<br/>
And the right valiant Banquo walk&rsquo;d too late;<br/>
Whom, you may say, if&rsquo;t please you, Fleance kill&rsquo;d,<br/>
For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.<br/>
Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous<br/>
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain<br/>
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!<br/>
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight,<br/>
In pious rage, the two delinquents tear<br/>
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?<br/>
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;<br/>
For &rsquo;twould have anger&rsquo;d any heart alive,<br/>
To hear the men deny&rsquo;t. So that, I say,<br/>
He has borne all things well: and I do think,<br/>
That had he Duncan&rsquo;s sons under his key<br/>
(As, and&rsquo;t please heaven, he shall not) they should find<br/>
What &rsquo;twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.<br/>
But, peace!&mdash;for from broad words, and &rsquo;cause he fail&rsquo;d<br/>
His presence at the tyrant&rsquo;s feast, I hear,<br/>
Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell<br/>
Where he bestows himself?
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
The son of Duncan,<br/>
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,<br/>
Lives in the English court and is receiv&rsquo;d<br/>
Of the most pious Edward with such grace<br/>
That the malevolence of fortune nothing<br/>
Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff<br/>
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid<br/>
To wake Northumberland, and warlike Siward<br/>
That, by the help of these (with Him above<br/>
To ratify the work), we may again<br/>
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights;<br/>
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,<br/>
Do faithful homage, and receive free honours,<br/>
All which we pine for now. And this report<br/>
Hath so exasperate the King that he<br/>
Prepares for some attempt of war.
</p>

<p>LENNOX.<br/>
Sent he to Macduff?
</p>

<p>LORD.<br/>
He did: and with an absolute &ldquo;Sir, not I,&rdquo;<br/>
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,<br/>
And hums, as who should say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll rue the time<br/>
That clogs me with this answer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>LENNOX.<br/>
And that well might<br/>
Advise him to a caution, t&rsquo; hold what distance<br/>
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel<br/>
Fly to the court of England, and unfold<br/>
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing<br/>
May soon return to this our suffering country<br/>
Under a hand accurs&rsquo;d!

He had none:<br/>
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,<br/>

<p>LADY MACDUFF.<br/>
Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,<br/>
His mansion, and his titles, in a place<br/>
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not:<br/>
He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,<br/>
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,<br/>

Why, one that swears and lies.

Let us seek out some desolate shade and there<br/>
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Let us rather<br/>
Hold fast the mortal sword, and, like good men,<br/>
Bestride our down-fall&rsquo;n birthdom. Each new morn<br/>
New widows howl, new orphans cry; new sorrows<br/>
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds<br/>
As if it felt with Scotland, and yell&rsquo;d out<br/>
Like syllable of dolour.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
What I believe, I&rsquo;ll wail;<br/>
What know, believe; and what I can redress,<br/>
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.<br/>
What you have spoke, it may be so, perchance.<br/>
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,<br/>
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well;<br/>
He hath not touch&rsquo;d you yet. I am young; but something<br/>
You may deserve of him through me; and wisdom<br/>
To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb<br/>
To appease an angry god.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
I am not treacherous.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
But Macbeth is.<br/>
A good and virtuous nature may recoil<br/>
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon.<br/>
That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.<br/>
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell:<br/>
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,<br/>
Yet grace must still look so.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
I have lost my hopes.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.<br/>
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,<br/>
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,<br/>
Without leave-taking?&mdash;I pray you,<br/>
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,<br/>
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,<br/>
Whatever I shall think.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Bleed, bleed, poor country!<br/>
Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure,<br/>
For goodness dare not check thee! wear thou thy wrongs;<br/>
The title is affeer&rsquo;d.&mdash;Fare thee well, lord:<br/>
I would not be the villain that thou think&rsquo;st<br/>
For the whole space that&rsquo;s in the tyrant&rsquo;s grasp<br/>
And the rich East to boot.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Be not offended:<br/>
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.<br/>
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;<br/>
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash<br/>
Is added to her wounds. I think, withal,<br/>
There would be hands uplifted in my right;<br/>
And here, from gracious England, have I offer<br/>
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,<br/>
When I shall tread upon the tyrant&rsquo;s head,<br/>
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country<br/>
Shall have more vices than it had before,<br/>
More suffer, and more sundry ways than ever,<br/>
By him that shall succeed.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
What should he be?
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
It is myself I mean; in whom I know<br/>
All the particulars of vice so grafted<br/>
That, when they shall be open&rsquo;d, black Macbeth<br/>
Will seem as pure as snow; and the poor state<br/>
Esteem him as a lamb, being compar&rsquo;d<br/>
With my confineless harms.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Not in the legions<br/>
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn&rsquo;d<br/>
In evils to top Macbeth.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
I grant him bloody,<br/>
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br/>
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br/>
That has a name: but there&rsquo;s no bottom, none,<br/>
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br/>
Your matrons, and your maids, could not fill up<br/>
The cistern of my lust; and my desire<br/>
All continent impediments would o&rsquo;erbear,<br/>
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth<br/>
Than such an one to reign.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Boundless intemperance<br/>
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been<br/>
Th&rsquo; untimely emptying of the happy throne,<br/>
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet<br/>
To take upon you what is yours: you may<br/>
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,<br/>
And yet seem cold&mdash;the time you may so hoodwink.<br/>
We have willing dames enough; there cannot be<br/>
That vulture in you, to devour so many<br/>
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,<br/>
Finding it so inclin&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
With this there grows<br/>
In my most ill-compos&rsquo;d affection such<br/>
A staunchless avarice, that, were I king,<br/>
I should cut off the nobles for their lands;<br/>
Desire his jewels, and this other&rsquo;s house:<br/>
And my more-having would be as a sauce<br/>
To make me hunger more; that I should forge<br/>
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,<br/>
Destroying them for wealth.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
This avarice<br/>
Sticks deeper; grows with more pernicious root<br/>
Than summer-seeming lust; and it hath been<br/>
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;<br/>
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will,<br/>
Of your mere own. All these are portable,<br/>
With other graces weigh&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,<br/>
As justice, verity, temp&rsquo;rance, stableness,<br/>
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,<br/>
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,<br/>
I have no relish of them; but abound<br/>
In the division of each several crime,<br/>
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should<br/>
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,<br/>
Uproar the universal peace, confound<br/>
All unity on earth.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
O Scotland, Scotland!
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:<br/>
I am as I have spoken.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Fit to govern?<br/>
No, not to live.&mdash;O nation miserable,<br/>
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter&rsquo;d,<br/>
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,<br/>
Since that the truest issue of thy throne<br/>
By his own interdiction stands accus&rsquo;d,<br/>
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father<br/>
Was a most sainted king. The queen that bore thee,<br/>
Oft&rsquo;ner upon her knees than on her feet,<br/>
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!<br/>
These evils thou repeat&rsquo;st upon thyself<br/>
Have banish&rsquo;d me from Scotland.&mdash;O my breast,<br/>
Thy hope ends here!
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Macduff, this noble passion,<br/>
Child of integrity, hath from my soul<br/>
Wiped the black scruples, reconcil&rsquo;d my thoughts<br/>
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth<br/>
By many of these trains hath sought to win me<br/>
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me<br/>
From over-credulous haste: but God above<br/>
Deal between thee and me! for even now<br/>
I put myself to thy direction, and<br/>
Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure<br/>
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,<br/>
For strangers to my nature. I am yet<br/>
Unknown to woman; never was forsworn;<br/>
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own;<br/>
At no time broke my faith; would not betray<br/>
The devil to his fellow; and delight<br/>
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking<br/>
Was this upon myself. What I am truly,<br/>
Is thine and my poor country&rsquo;s to command:<br/>
Whither, indeed, before thy here-approach,<br/>
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,<br/>
Already at a point, was setting forth.<br/>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
That of an hour&rsquo;s age doth hiss the speaker;<br/>
Each minute teems a new one.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
How does my wife?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
Why, well.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
And all my children?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
Well too.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
The tyrant has not batter&rsquo;d at their peace?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
No; they were well at peace when I did leave &rsquo;em.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Be not a niggard of your speech: how goes&rsquo;t?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
When I came hither to transport the tidings,<br/>
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour<br/>
Of many worthy fellows that were out;<br/>
Which was to my belief witness&rsquo;d the rather,<br/>
For that I saw the tyrant&rsquo;s power afoot.<br/>
Now is the time of help. Your eye in Scotland<br/>
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,<br/>
To doff their dire distresses.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Be&rsquo;t their comfort<br/>
We are coming thither. Gracious England hath<br/>
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;<br/>
An older and a better soldier none<br/>
That Christendom gives out.
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
Would I could answer<br/>
This comfort with the like! But I have words<br/>
That would be howl&rsquo;d out in the desert air,<br/>
Where hearing should not latch them.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
What concern they?<br/>
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief<br/>
Due to some single breast?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
No mind that&rsquo;s honest<br/>
But in it shares some woe, though the main part<br/>
Pertains to you alone.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
If it be mine,<br/>
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,<br/>
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound<br/>
That ever yet they heard.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Humh! I guess at it.
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
Your castle is surpris&rsquo;d; your wife and babes<br/>
Savagely slaughter&rsquo;d. To relate the manner<br/>
Were, on the quarry of these murder&rsquo;d deer,<br/>
To add the death of you.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Merciful heaven!&mdash;<br/>
What, man! ne&rsquo;er pull your hat upon your brows.<br/>
Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak<br/>
Whispers the o&rsquo;er-fraught heart, and bids it break.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
My children too?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
Wife, children, servants, all<br/>
That could be found.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
And I must be from thence!<br/>
My wife kill&rsquo;d too?
</p>

<p>ROSS.<br/>
I have said.
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Be comforted:<br/>
Let&rsquo;s make us med&rsquo;cines of our great revenge,<br/>
To cure this deadly grief.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
He has no children.&mdash;All my pretty ones?<br/>
Did you say all?&mdash;O hell-kite!&mdash;All?<br/>
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam<br/>
At one fell swoop?
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Dispute it like a man.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
I shall do so;<br/>
But I must also feel it as a man:<br/>
I cannot but remember such things were,<br/>
That were most precious to me.&mdash;Did heaven look on,<br/>
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,<br/>
They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,<br/>
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,<br/>
Fell slaughter on their souls: heaven rest them now!
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief<br/>
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
</p>

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes,<br/>
And braggart with my tongue!&mdash;But, gentle heavens,<br/>
Cut short all intermission; front to front,<br/>
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;<br/>
Within my sword&rsquo;s length set him; if he &rsquo;scape,<br/>
Heaven forgive him too!
</p>

<p>MALCOLM.<br/>
This tune goes manly.<br/>
Come, go we to the King. Our power is ready;<br/>
Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth<br/>
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above<br/>
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may;<br/>
The night is long that never finds the day.

<h2><b>ACT V</b></h2>

<h3><b>SCENE I. Dunsinane. A Room in the Castle.</b></h3>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter a <span class="charname">Doctor of Physic</span> and a
<span class="charname">Waiting-Gentlewoman</span>.</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no truth in your report.
When was it she last walked?
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Since his Majesty went into the field, I have seen her rise from her bed, throw
her nightgown upon her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it, write
upon&rsquo;t, read it, afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all
this while in a most fast sleep.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the benefit of sleep, and do
the effects of watching. In this slumbery agitation, besides her walking and
other actual performances, what, at any time, have you heard her say?
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
You may to me; and &rsquo;tis most meet you should.
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Neither to you nor anyone; having no witness to confirm my speech.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Lady Macbeth</span> with a taper.</p>

<p>Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise; and, upon my life, fast
asleep. Observe her; stand close.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
How came she by that light?
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her continually; &rsquo;tis her command.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
You see, her eyes are open.
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Ay, but their sense are shut.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands. I have
known her continue in this a quarter of an hour.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Yet here&rsquo;s a spot.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Hark, she speaks. I will set down what comes from her, to satisfy my
remembrance the more strongly.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Out, damned spot! out, I say! One; two. Why, then &rsquo;tis time to
do&rsquo;t. Hell is murky! Fie, my lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need
we fear who knows it, when none can call our power to account? Yet who would
have thought the old man to have had so much blood in him?
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Do you mark that?
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
The Thane of Fife had a wife. Where is she now?&mdash;What, will these hands
ne&rsquo;er be clean? No more o&rsquo; that, my lord, no more o&rsquo; that:
you mar all with this starting.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Go to, go to. You have known what you should not.
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of that: heaven knows what she has
known.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Here&rsquo;s the smell of the blood still: all the perfumes of Arabia will not
sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the whole body.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Well, well, well.
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Pray God it be, sir.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
This disease is beyond my practice: yet I have known those which have walked in
their sleep, who have died holily in their beds.
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so pale. I tell you yet again,
Banquo&rsquo;s buried; he cannot come out on&rsquo;s grave.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Even so?
</p>

<p>LADY MACBETH.<br/>
To bed, to bed. There&rsquo;s knocking at the gate. Come, come, come, come,
give me your hand. What&rsquo;s done cannot be undone. To bed, to bed, to bed.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Will she go now to bed?
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Directly.
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Foul whisp&rsquo;rings are abroad. Unnatural deeds<br/>
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds<br/>
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.<br/>
More needs she the divine than the physician.&mdash;<br/>
God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;<br/>
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,<br/>
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:<br/>
My mind she has mated, and amaz&rsquo;d my sight.<br/>
I think, but dare not speak.
</p>

<p>GENTLEWOMAN.<br/>
Good night, good doctor.

<p>MENTEITH.<br/>
The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,<br/>

Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm<br/>
Excite the mortified man.
</p>

<p>ANGUS.<br/>
Near Birnam wood<br/>
Shall we well meet them. That way are they coming.
</p>

<p>CAITHNESS.<br/>
Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
</p>

<p>LENNOX.<br/>
For certain, sir, he is not. I have a file<br/>
Of all the gentry: there is Siward&rsquo;s son<br/>
And many unrough youths, that even now<br/>
Protest their first of manhood.
</p>

<p>MENTEITH.<br/>
What does the tyrant?
</p>

<p>CAITHNESS.<br/>
Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.<br/>
Some say he&rsquo;s mad; others, that lesser hate him,<br/>
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,<br/>
He cannot buckle his distemper&rsquo;d cause<br/>
Within the belt of rule.
</p>

<p>ANGUS.<br/>
Now does he feel<br/>
His secret murders sticking on his hands;<br/>
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;<br/>
Those he commands move only in command,<br/>
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title<br/>
Hang loose about him, like a giant&rsquo;s robe<br/>
Upon a dwarfish thief.
</p>

<p>MENTEITH.<br/>
Who, then, shall blame<br/>
His pester&rsquo;d senses to recoil and start,<br/>
When all that is within him does condemn<br/>
Itself for being there?
</p>

<p>CAITHNESS.<br/>
Well, march we on,<br/>
To give obedience where &rsquo;tis truly ow&rsquo;d:<br/>
Meet we the med&rsquo;cine of the sickly weal;<br/>
And with him pour we, in our country&rsquo;s purge,<br/>
Each drop of us.
</p>

<p>LENNOX.<br/>
Or so much as it needs<br/>
To dew the sovereign flower, and drown the weeds.<br/>
Make we our march towards Birnam.

Is fall&rsquo;n into the sere, the yellow leaf;<br/>
And that which should accompany old age,<br/>
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,<br/>

Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,<br/>
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not.<br/>

All is confirm&rsquo;d, my lord, which was reported.

I&rsquo;ll put it on.<br/>
Send out more horses, skirr the country round;<br/>
Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.&mdash;<br/>
How does your patient, doctor?
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Not so sick, my lord,<br/>
As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,<br/>
That keep her from her rest.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Cure her of that:<br/>
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseas&rsquo;d,<br/>
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,<br/>
Raze out the written troubles of the brain,<br/>
And with some sweet oblivious antidote<br/>
Cleanse the stuff&rsquo;d bosom of that perilous stuff<br/>
Which weighs upon the heart?
</p>

<p>DOCTOR.<br/>
Therein the patient<br/>
Must minister to himself.
</p>

<p>MACBETH.<br/>
Throw physic to the dogs, I&rsquo;ll none of it.<br/>
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff:<br/>
Seyton, send out.&mdash;Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.&mdash;<br/>
Come, sir, despatch.&mdash;If thou couldst, doctor, cast<br/>
The water of my land, find her disease,<br/>
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,<br/>
I would applaud thee to the very echo,<br/>
That should applaud again.&mdash;Pull&rsquo;t off, I say.&mdash;<br/>
What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug,<br/>
Would scour these English hence? Hear&rsquo;st thou of them?

Ay, my good lord. Your royal preparation<br/>
Makes us hear something.

Or else my sword, with an unbatter&rsquo;d edge,<br/>
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;<br/>
By this great clatter, one of greatest note<br/>
Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!<br/>
And more I beg not.

The tyrant&rsquo;s people on both sides do fight;<br/>
The noble thanes do bravely in the war,<br/>

That keep the word of promise to our ear,<br/>
And break it to our hope!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not fight with thee.

<p>MACDUFF.<br/>
Then yield thee, coward,<br/>
And live to be the show and gaze o&rsquo; th&rsquo; time.<br/>

a team of about twenty Project Gutenberg volunteers.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
