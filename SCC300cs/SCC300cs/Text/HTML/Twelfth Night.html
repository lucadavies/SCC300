<h2>ACT I.</h2>

<h3>SCENE I. An Apartment in the Duke&rsquo;s Palace.</h3>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Orsino,</span> Duke of
Illyria,<span class="charname"> Curio,</span> and other Lords; Musicians attending.</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
If music be the food of love, play on,<br/>
Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting,<br/>
The appetite may sicken and so die.<br/>
That strain again, it had a dying fall;<br/>
O, it came o&rsquo;er my ear like the sweet sound<br/>
That breathes upon a bank of violets,<br/>
Stealing and giving odour. Enough; no more;<br/>
&rsquo;Tis not so sweet now as it was before.<br/>
O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou,<br/>
That notwithstanding thy capacity<br/>
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,<br/>
Of what validity and pitch soever,<br/>
But falls into abatement and low price<br/>
Even in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy,<br/>
That it alone is high fantastical.
</p>

<p>CURIO.<br/>
Will you go hunt, my lord?
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
What, Curio?
</p>

<p>CURIO.<br/>
The hart.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Why so I do, the noblest that I have.<br/>
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,<br/>
Methought she purg&rsquo;d the air of pestilence;<br/>
That instant was I turn&rsquo;d into a hart,<br/>
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,<br/>
E&rsquo;er since pursue me. How now? what news from her?
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Valentine</span>.</p>

<p>VALENTINE.<br/>
So please my lord, I might not be admitted,<br/>
But from her handmaid do return this answer:<br/>
The element itself, till seven years&rsquo; heat,<br/>
Shall not behold her face at ample view;<br/>
But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,<br/>
And water once a day her chamber round<br/>
With eye-offending brine: all this to season<br/>
A brother&rsquo;s dead love, which she would keep fresh<br/>
And lasting in her sad remembrance.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame<br/>
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,<br/>
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft<br/>
Hath kill&rsquo;d the flock of all affections else<br/>
That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,<br/>
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill&rsquo;d<br/>
Her sweet perfections with one self king!<br/>
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers,<br/>
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

<h3>SCENE II. The sea-coast.</h3>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Viola,</span> a
<span class="charname">Captain</span> and Sailors.</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
What country, friends, is this?
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
This is Illyria, lady.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
And what should I do in Illyria?<br/>
My brother he is in Elysium.<br/>
Perchance he is not drown&rsquo;d. What think you, sailors?
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
It is perchance that you yourself were sav&rsquo;d.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
True, madam; and to comfort you with chance,<br/>
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,<br/>
When you, and those poor number sav&rsquo;d with you,<br/>
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,<br/>
Most provident in peril, bind himself,<br/>
(Courage and hope both teaching him the practice)<br/>
To a strong mast that liv&rsquo;d upon the sea;<br/>
Where, like Arion on the dolphin&rsquo;s back,<br/>
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves<br/>
So long as I could see.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
For saying so, there&rsquo;s gold!<br/>
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,<br/>
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,<br/>
The like of him. Know&rsquo;st thou this country?
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born<br/>
Not three hours&rsquo; travel from this very place.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Who governs here?
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
A noble duke, in nature as in name.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
What is his name?
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
Orsino.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Orsino! I have heard my father name him.<br/>
He was a bachelor then.
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
And so is now, or was so very late;<br/>
For but a month ago I went from hence,<br/>
And then &rsquo;twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know,<br/>
What great ones do, the less will prattle of)<br/>
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
What&rsquo;s she?
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count<br/>
That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her<br/>
In the protection of his son, her brother,<br/>
Who shortly also died; for whose dear love<br/>
They say, she hath abjur&rsquo;d the company<br/>
And sight of men.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
O that I served that lady,<br/>
And might not be delivered to the world,<br/>
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,<br/>
What my estate is.
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
That were hard to compass,<br/>
Because she will admit no kind of suit,<br/>
No, not the Duke&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;<br/>
And though that nature with a beauteous wall<br/>
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee<br/>
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits<br/>
With this thy fair and outward character.<br/>
I pray thee, and I&rsquo;ll pay thee bounteously,<br/>
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid<br/>
For such disguise as haply shall become<br/>
The form of my intent. I&rsquo;ll serve this duke;<br/>
Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him.<br/>
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing,<br/>
And speak to him in many sorts of music,<br/>
That will allow me very worth his service.<br/>
What else may hap, to time I will commit;<br/>
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
</p>

<p>CAPTAIN.<br/>
Be you his eunuch and your mute I&rsquo;ll be;<br/>
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I thank thee. Lead me on.

<h3>SCENE III. A Room in Olivia&rsquo;s House.</h3>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Sir Toby</span> and
<span class="charname">Maria</span>.</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure
care&rsquo;s an enemy to life.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o&rsquo; nights; your cousin,
my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Why, let her except, before excepted.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Confine? I&rsquo;ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good
enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang
themselves in their own straps.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday;
and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Ay, he.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
He&rsquo;s as tall a man as any&rsquo;s in Illyria.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
What&rsquo;s that to th&rsquo; purpose?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Ay, but he&rsquo;ll have but a year in all these ducats. He&rsquo;s a very
fool, and a prodigal.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Fie, that you&rsquo;ll say so! he plays o&rsquo; the viol-de-gamboys, and
speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the
good gifts of nature.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
He hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he&rsquo;s a fool, he&rsquo;s
a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the
gust he hath in quarrelling, &rsquo;tis thought among the prudent he would
quickly have the gift of a grave.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are
they?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
They that add, moreover, he&rsquo;s drunk nightly in your company.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
With drinking healths to my niece; I&rsquo;ll drink to her as long as there is
a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He&rsquo;s a coward and a coystril
that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o&rsquo; the toe like a
parish top. What, wench! <i>Castiliano vulgo:</i> for here comes Sir Andrew
Agueface.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Sir Andrew</span>.</p>

<p>AGUECHEEK.<br/>
Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Sweet Sir Andrew!
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Bless you, fair shrew.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
And you too, sir.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
What&rsquo;s that?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
My niece&rsquo;s chamber-maid.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
My name is Mary, sir.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Good Mistress Mary Accost,&mdash;
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
You mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail her.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of
accost?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Fare you well, gentlemen.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady,
do you think you have fools in hand?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Sir, I have not you by the hand.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Marry, but you shall have, and here&rsquo;s my hand.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th&rsquo; buttery bar
and let it drink.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Wherefore, sweetheart? What&rsquo;s your metaphor?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
It&rsquo;s dry, sir.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But
what&rsquo;s your jest?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
A dry jest, sir.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Are you full of them?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers&rsquo; ends: marry, now I let go your hand,
I am barren.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit <span class="charname">Maria</span>.</i>]</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
O knight, thou lack&rsquo;st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put down?
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks
sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am
a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
No question.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
And I thought that, I&rsquo;d forswear it. I&rsquo;ll ride home tomorrow, Sir
Toby.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
<i>Pourquoy</i>, my dear knight?
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
What is <i>pourquoy?</i> Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the
tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but
followed the arts!
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Why, would that have mended my hair?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
But it becomes me well enough, does&rsquo;t not?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a houswife take
thee between her legs, and spin it off.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Faith, I&rsquo;ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if
she be, it&rsquo;s four to one she&rsquo;ll none of me; the Count himself here
hard by woos her.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
She&rsquo;ll none o&rsquo; the Count; she&rsquo;ll not match above her degree,
neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear&rsquo;t. Tut,
there&rsquo;s life in&rsquo;t, man.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o&rsquo; the strangest mind
i&rsquo; the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Art thou good at these kick-shawses, knight?
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and
yet I will not compare with an old man.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Faith, I can cut a caper.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
And I can cut the mutton to&rsquo;t.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before
&rsquo;em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall&rsquo;s picture? Why
dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very
walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace.
What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the
excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Ay, &rsquo;tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
dam&rsquo;d-colour&rsquo;d stock. Shall we set about some revels?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus?
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Taurus? That&rsquo;s sides and heart.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha, ha,
excellent!

<h3>SCENE IV. A Room in the Duke&rsquo;s Palace.</h3>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Valentine</span> and
<span class="charname">Viola</span> in man&rsquo;s attire.</p>

<p>VALENTINE.<br/>
If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be
much advanced; he hath known you but three days, and already you are no
stranger.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the
continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
</p>

<p>VALENTINE.<br/>
No, believe me.
</p>

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Duke, Curio</span> and Attendants.</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I thank you. Here comes the Count.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Who saw Cesario, ho?
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
On your attendance, my lord, here.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Stand you awhile aloof.&mdash;Cesario,<br/>
Thou know&rsquo;st no less but all; I have unclasp&rsquo;d<br/>
To thee the book even of my secret soul.<br/>
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her,<br/>
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,<br/>
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow<br/>
Till thou have audience.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Sure, my noble lord,<br/>
If she be so abandon&rsquo;d to her sorrow<br/>
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds,<br/>
Rather than make unprofited return.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
O then unfold the passion of my love,<br/>
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith;<br/>
It shall become thee well to act my woes;<br/>
She will attend it better in thy youth,<br/>
Than in a nuncio&rsquo;s of more grave aspect.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I think not so, my lord.
</p>

<p>DUKE.<br/>
Dear lad, believe it;<br/>
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,<br/>
That say thou art a man: Diana&rsquo;s lip<br/>
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe<br/>
Is as the maiden&rsquo;s organ, shrill and sound,<br/>
And all is semblative a woman&rsquo;s part.<br/>
I know thy constellation is right apt<br/>
For this affair. Some four or five attend him:<br/>
All, if you will; for I myself am best<br/>
When least in company. Prosper well in this,<br/>
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,<br/>
To call his fortunes thine.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I&rsquo;ll do my best<br/>
To woo your lady. [<i>Aside.</i>] Yet, a barful strife!<br/>
Whoe&rsquo;er I woo, myself would be his wife.

Nay; either tell me where thou hast been, or I will not open my lips so wide as

absence.

Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this world needs to fear no colours.

</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
A good lenten answer. I can tell thee where that saying was born, of I fear no
colours.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Where, good Mistress Mary?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
In the wars, and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those that are fools, let them use
their talents.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or to be turned away; is not
that as good as a hanging to you?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and for turning away, let summer
bear it out.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
You are resolute then?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Not so, neither, but I am resolved on two points.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
That if one break, the other will hold; or if both break, your gaskins fall.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Apt, in good faith, very apt! Well, go thy way; if Sir Toby would leave
drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eve&rsquo;s flesh as any in Illyria.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Peace, you rogue, no more o&rsquo; that. Here comes my lady: make your excuse
wisely, you were best.

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Wit, and&rsquo;t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think
they have thee, do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee, may
pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? Better a witty fool than a
foolish wit. God bless thee, lady!
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Take the fool away.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Go to, y&rsquo;are a dry fool; I&rsquo;ll no more of you. Besides, you grow
dishonest.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend: for give the dry
fool drink, then is the fool not dry; bid the dishonest man mend himself, if he
mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him.
Anything that&rsquo;s mended is but patched; virtue that transgresses is but
patched with sin, and sin that amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no
true cuckold but calamity, so beauty&rsquo;s a flower. The lady bade take away
the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Sir, I bade them take away you.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, <i>cucullus non facit
monachum:</i> that&rsquo;s as much to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good
madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Can you do it?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Dexteriously, good madonna.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Make your proof.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Well sir, for want of other idleness, I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;bide your proof.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Good madonna, why mourn&rsquo;st thou?
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Good fool, for my brother&rsquo;s death.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
The more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother&rsquo;s soul being in
heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays
the wise, doth ever make the better fool.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!
Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his word for
twopence that you are no fool.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
How say you to that, Malvolio?
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him put
down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more brain than a stone.
Look you now, he&rsquo;s out of his guard already; unless you laugh and
minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men, that
crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools&rsquo; zanies.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite.
To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for
bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allowed
fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man,
though he do nothing but reprove.

Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. I told him you were

you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too,

He&rsquo;s fortified against any denial.

Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,&mdash;I pray you, tell me if
this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast
away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken
great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Whence came you, sir?
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I can say little more than I have studied, and that question&rsquo;s out of my

house, that I may proceed in my speech.

No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not

If I do not usurp myself, I am.
</p>

Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to

my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message.

Come to what is important in&rsquo;t: I forgive you the praise.

Alas, I took great pains to study it, and &rsquo;tis poetical.

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were
saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to
hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: &rsquo;tis not

Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so
fearful. Speak your office.

If you will lead these graces to the grave,<br/>
And leave the world no copy.

O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give out divers schedules of my
beauty. It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labelled to my
will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey eyes with lids to
them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise
me?
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I see you what you are, you are too proud;<br/>
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.<br/>
My lord and master loves you. O, such love<br/>
Could be but recompens&rsquo;d though you were crown&rsquo;d<br/>

How does he love me?
</p>

With adorations, fertile tears,<br/>
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him:<br/>
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,<br/>
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;<br/>
In voices well divulg&rsquo;d, free, learn&rsquo;d, and valiant,<br/>
And in dimension and the shape of nature,<br/>
A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him.<br/>
He might have took his answer long ago.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
If I did love you in my master&rsquo;s flame,<br/>
With such a suff&rsquo;ring, such a deadly life,<br/>
In your denial I would find no sense,<br/>
I would not understand it.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Why, what would you?
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Make me a willow cabin at your gate,<br/>
And call upon my soul within the house;<br/>
Write loyal cantons of contemned love,<br/>
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;<br/>
Hallow your name to the reverberate hills,<br/>
And make the babbling gossip of the air<br/>
Cry out Olivia! O, you should not rest<br/>
Between the elements of air and earth,<br/>
But you should pity me.
</p>

You might do much.<br/>
What is your parentage?

Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:<br/>
I am a gentleman.

I cannot love him: let him send no more,<br/>
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,<br/>
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:<br/>
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I am no fee&rsquo;d post, lady; keep your purse;<br/>
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.<br/>
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love,<br/>

Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you?

By your patience, no; my stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate

I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any
of them on you.

</p>

<p>SEBASTIAN.<br/>
No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in
you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am
willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express
myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called
Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard
of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the
heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that,
for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister
drowned.
</p>

<p>ANTONIO.<br/>
Alas the day!
</p>

<p>SEBASTIAN.<br/>
A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many
accounted beautiful. But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar
believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her, she bore a mind that envy
could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I
seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
</p>

<p>ANTONIO.<br/>
Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant.

If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have
recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom is full of kindness,
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion
more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino&rsquo;s

By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty
shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spok&rsquo;st of
Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus; &rsquo;twas
very good, i&rsquo; faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman. Hadst it?
</p>

I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio&rsquo;s nose is no whipstock. My
lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Excellent! Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Come on, there is sixpence for you. Let&rsquo;s have a song.

Ay, ay. I care not for good life.

Very sweet and contagious, i&rsquo; faith.

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin
dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that?

Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight. Since the youth of the Count&rsquo;s

me alone with him. If I do not gull him into a nayword, and make him a common

I have no exquisite reason for&rsquo;t, but I have reason good enough.

The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser, an
affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths;
the best persuaded of himself, so crammed (as he thinks) with excellencies,
that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him. And on that
vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
What wilt thou do?
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the colour of
his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his
eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated.
I can write very like my lady your niece; on a forgotten matter we can hardly
make distinction of our hands.

Excellent! I smell a device.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
I have&rsquo;t in my nose too.
</p>

He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my
niece, and that she is in love with him.

My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour.
</p>

More than light airs and recollected terms<br/>
Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.<br/>
Come, but one verse.

And what&rsquo;s her history?

A blank, my lord. She never told her love,<br/>
But let concealment, like a worm i&rsquo; th&rsquo; bud,<br/>
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,<br/>
And with a green and yellow melancholy<br/>
She sat like patience on a monument,<br/>
Smiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed?<br/>
We men may say more, swear more, but indeed,<br/>
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove<br/>
Much in our vows, but little in our love.

&lsquo;No man must know.&rsquo;&mdash;If this should be thee, Malvolio?

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
A fustian riddle!
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Excellent wench, say I.
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
&lsquo;M.O.A.I. doth sway my life.&rsquo;&mdash;Nay, but first let me see, let
me see, let me see.
</p>

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
What dish o&rsquo; poison has she dressed him!
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
And with what wing the staniel checks at it!
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
&lsquo;I may command where I adore.&rsquo; Why, she may command me: I serve
her, she is my lady. Why, this is evident to any formal capacity. There is no
obstruction in this. And the end&mdash;what should that alphabetical position
portend? If I could make that resemble something in me! Softly!
&lsquo;M.O.A.I.&rsquo;&mdash;

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
O, ay, make up that:&mdash;he is now at a cold scent.

Did not I say he would work it out? The cur is excellent at faults.
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
&lsquo;M&rsquo;&mdash;But then there is no consonancy in the sequel; that
suffers under probation: &lsquo;A&rsquo; should follow, but &lsquo;O&rsquo;
does.
</p>

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
And &lsquo;O&rsquo; shall end, I hope.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Ay, or I&rsquo;ll cudgel him, and make him cry &lsquo;O!&rsquo;

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
And then &lsquo;I&rsquo; comes behind.

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
Ay, and you had any eye behind you, you might see more detraction at your heels
than fortunes before you.
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
&lsquo;M.O.A.I.&rsquo; This simulation is not as the former: and yet, to crush
this a little, it would bow to me, for every one of these letters are in my
name. Soft, here follows prose.<br/>
[<i>Reads.</i>] <i>If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I am above
thee, but be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve
greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon &rsquo;em. Thy fates open their
hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them. And, to inure thyself to what
thou art like to be, cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be opposite with
a kinsman, surly with servants. Let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put
thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for
thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
cross-gartered. I say, remember. Go to, thou art made, if thou desir&rsquo;st
to be so. If not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
not worthy to touch Fortune&rsquo;s fingers. Farewell. She that would alter

Daylight and champian discovers not more! This is open. I will be proud, I will
read politic authors, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
acquaintance, I will be point-device, the very man. I do not now fool myself,
to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg
being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a
kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars,
I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered,
even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised!&mdash;Here
is yet a postscript. [<i>Reads.</i>] <i>Thou canst not choose but know who I

wilt have me.

he must run mad.

Nay, but say true, does it work upon him?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark his first approach before my
lady: he will come to her in yellow stockings, and &rsquo;tis a colour she
abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests; and he will smile upon her,
which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt. If
you will see it, follow me.

<p class="scenedesc"> Enter <span class="charname">Viola</span> and
<span class="charname">Clown</span> with a tabor.</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Save thee, friend, and thy music. Dost thou live by thy tabor?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
No, sir, I live by the church.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Art thou a churchman?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
No such matter, sir. I do live by the church, for I do live at my house, and my
house doth stand by the church.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
So thou mayst say the king lies by a beggar, if a beggar dwell near him; or the
church stands by thy tabor, if thy tabor stand by the church.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is but a chev&rsquo;ril glove
to a good wit. How quickly the wrong side may be turned outward!
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Nay, that&rsquo;s certain; they that dally nicely with words may quickly make
them wanton.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Why, man?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Why, sir, her name&rsquo;s a word; and to dally with that word might make my
sister wanton. But indeed, words are very rascals, since bonds disgraced them.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Thy reason, man?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words, and words are grown so false, I
am loath to prove reason with them.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car&rsquo;st for nothing.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Not so, sir, I do care for something. But in my conscience, sir, I do not care
for you. If that be to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you
invisible.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Art not thou the Lady Olivia&rsquo;s fool?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly. She will keep no fool, sir, till
she be married, and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings,
the husband&rsquo;s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter
of words.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I saw thee late at the Count Orsino&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun; it shines everywhere. I
would be sorry, sir, but the fool should be as oft with your master as with my
mistress. I think I saw your wisdom there.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Nay, and thou pass upon me, I&rsquo;ll no more with thee. Hold, there&rsquo;s
expenses for thee.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
By my troth, I&rsquo;ll tell thee, I am almost sick for one, though I would not
have it grow on my chin. Is thy lady within?
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Yes, being kept together, and put to use.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this
Troilus.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I understand you, sir; &rsquo;tis well begged.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a
beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who
you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say
&ldquo;element&rdquo;, but the word is overworn.
</p>

<p class="right"> [<i>Exit.</i>]</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
This fellow is wise enough to play the fool,<br/>
And to do that well, craves a kind of wit:<br/>
He must observe their mood on whom he jests,<br/>
The quality of persons, and the time,<br/>
And like the haggard, check at every feather<br/>
That comes before his eye. This is a practice<br/>
As full of labour as a wise man&rsquo;s art:<br/>
For folly, that he wisely shows, is fit;<br/>

Cesario is your servant&rsquo;s name, fair princess.

My servant, sir! &rsquo;Twas never merry world,<br/>
Since lowly feigning was call&rsquo;d compliment:<br/>
Y&rsquo;are servant to the Count Orsino, youth.

And he is yours, and his must needs be yours.<br/>
Your servant&rsquo;s servant is your servant, madam.
</p>

For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,<br/>
Would they were blanks rather than fill&rsquo;d with me!
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts<br/>
On his behalf.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
O, by your leave, I pray you.<br/>
I bade you never speak again of him.<br/>
But would you undertake another suit,<br/>
I had rather hear you to solicit that<br/>
Than music from the spheres.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Dear lady&mdash;
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,<br/>
After the last enchantment you did here,<br/>
A ring in chase of you. So did I abuse<br/>
Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you.<br/>
Under your hard construction must I sit;<br/>
To force that on you in a shameful cunning,<br/>
Which you knew none of yours. What might you think?<br/>
Have you not set mine honour at the stake,<br/>
And baited it with all th&rsquo; unmuzzled thoughts<br/>
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving<br/>
Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom,<br/>
Hides my heart: so let me hear you speak.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
I pity you.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
That&rsquo;s a degree to love.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
No, not a grize; for &rsquo;tis a vulgar proof<br/>
That very oft we pity enemies.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Why then methinks &rsquo;tis time to smile again.<br/>
O world, how apt the poor are to be proud!<br/>
If one should be a prey, how much the better<br/>
To fall before the lion than the wolf! [<i>Clock strikes.</i>]<br/>
The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.<br/>
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you.<br/>
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,<br/>
Your wife is like to reap a proper man.<br/>
There lies your way, due west.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Then westward ho!<br/>
Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship!<br/>
You&rsquo;ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Stay:<br/>
I prithee tell me what thou think&rsquo;st of me.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
That you do think you are not what you are.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
If I think so, I think the same of you.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Then think you right; I am not what I am.

I would you were as I would have you be.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Would it be better, madam, than I am?<br/>
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful<br/>
In the contempt and anger of his lip!<br/>
A murd&rsquo;rous guilt shows not itself more soon<br/>
Than love that would seem hid. Love&rsquo;s night is noon.<br/>
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,<br/>
By maidhood, honour, truth, and everything,<br/>
I love thee so, that maugre all thy pride,<br/>
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.<br/>
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,<br/>
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause;<br/>
But rather reason thus with reason fetter:<br/>
Love sought is good, but given unsought is better.
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
By innocence I swear, and by my youth,<br/>
I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth,<br/>
And that no woman has; nor never none<br/>
Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.<br/>
And so adieu, good madam; never more<br/>
Will I my master&rsquo;s tears to you deplore.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Yet come again: for thou perhaps mayst move<br/>
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.

You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
</p>

Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count&rsquo;s servingman than
ever she bestowed upon me; I saw&rsquo;t i&rsquo; th&rsquo; orchard.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
As plain as I see you now.
</p>

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
&rsquo;Slight! will you make an ass o&rsquo; me?
</p>

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of judgment and reason.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor.
</p>

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake
your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
You should then have accosted her, and with some excellent jests, fire-new from
the mint, you should have banged the youth into dumbness. This was looked for
at your hand, and this was balked: the double gilt of this opportunity you let
time wash off, and you are now sailed into the north of my lady&rsquo;s
opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman&rsquo;s beard, unless
you do redeem it by some laudable attempt, either of valour or policy.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
And&rsquo;t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as
lief be a Brownist as a politician.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the
Count&rsquo;s youth to fight with him. Hurt him in eleven places; my niece
shall take note of it, and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world
can more prevail in man&rsquo;s commendation with woman than report of valour.
</p>

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
</p>

<p>SIR ANDREW.<br/>
Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and brief; it is no matter how witty,
so it be eloquent and full of invention. Taunt him with the licence of ink. If
thou &lsquo;thou&rsquo;st&rsquo; him some thrice, it shall not be amiss, and as
many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough
for the bed of Ware in England, set &rsquo;em down. Go about it. Let there be
gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About
it.

Never trust me then. And by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think

the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a

It might have since been answered in repaying<br/>

It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here&rsquo;s my purse.<br/>
In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,<br/>
Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet<br/>
Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge<br/>
With viewing of the town. There shall you have me.

No, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some

Smil&rsquo;st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this
cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me
as the very true sonnet is: &lsquo;Please one and please all.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee?
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and

O ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This
concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear
stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. &lsquo;Cast thy
humble slough,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;be opposite with a kinsman, surly with
servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the
trick of singularity,&rsquo; and consequently, sets down the manner how: as, a
sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note,
and so forth. I have limed her, but it is Jove&rsquo;s doing, and Jove make me
thankful! And when she went away now, &lsquo;Let this fellow be looked
to;&rsquo; &lsquo;Fellow!&rsquo; not &lsquo;Malvolio&rsquo;, nor after my
degree, but &lsquo;fellow&rsquo;. Why, everything adheres together, that no
dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or
unsafe circumstance. What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me
and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and

Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young gentleman

ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a
clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon
Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his
youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill,

another by the look, like cockatrices.

He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet consideration, but he
is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his
incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but
by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob is his word; give&rsquo;t or
take&rsquo;t.

I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no
fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others
to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirk.

Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury;
therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house,
unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer
him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must,
that&rsquo;s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.

Well held out, i&rsquo; faith! No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you

Thou know&rsquo;st not me.

Vent my folly! He has heard that word of some great man, and now applies it to
a fool. Vent my folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world, will prove a
cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy strangeness, and tell me what I shall vent
to my lady. Shall I vent to her that thou art coming?

<p>SEBASTIAN.<br/>
I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me.<br/>
There&rsquo;s money for thee; if you tarry longer<br/>
I shall give worse payment.

</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged. Good Sir Topas, do not think I am mad.
They have laid me here in hideous darkness.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most modest terms, for I am one
of those gentle ones that will use the devil himself with courtesy.
Say&rsquo;st thou that house is dark?
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
As hell, Sir Topas.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Why, it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes, and the clerestories
toward the south-north are as lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of
obstruction?
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
I am not mad, Sir Topas. I say to you this house is dark.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Madman, thou errest. I say there is no darkness but ignorance, in which thou
art more puzzled than the Egyptians in their fog.
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
I say this house is as dark as ignorance, though ignorance were as dark as
hell; and I say there was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you are.
Make the trial of it in any constant question.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wildfowl?
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
What think&rsquo;st thou of his opinion?
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness. Thou shalt hold the opinion of
Pythagoras ere I will allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest thou
dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
</p>

<p>MALVOLIO.<br/>
Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
My most exquisite Sir Topas!

Nay, I am for all waters.
</p>

<p>MARIA.<br/>
Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and gown. He sees thee not.
</p>

<p>SIR TOBY.<br/>
To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how thou find&rsquo;st him. I
would we were well rid of this knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
would he were, for I am now so far in offence with my niece that I cannot
pursue with any safety this sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.

They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness, send ministers to me, asses,

Well-a-day that you were, sir!

By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper, and light, and convey what I

letter did.

I will help you to&rsquo;t. But tell me true, are you not mad indeed? or do you
but counterfeit?

Believe me, I am not. I tell thee true.

Nay, I&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er believe a madman till I see his brains. I will

Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,<br/>

His counsel now might do me golden service.<br/>
For though my soul disputes well with my sense<br/>
That this may be some error, but no madness,<br/>

To any other trust but that I am mad,<br/>

For shallow draught and bulk unprizable,<br/>

Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:<br/>
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,<br/>
Though, I confess, on base and ground enough,<br/>
Orsino&rsquo;s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:<br/>
That most ingrateful boy there by your side<br/>
From the rude sea&rsquo;s enraged and foamy mouth<br/>
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was.<br/>
His life I gave him, and did thereto add<br/>
My love, without retention or restraint,<br/>
All his in dedication. For his sake<br/>
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,<br/>
Into the danger of this adverse town;<br/>
Drew to defend him when he was beset;<br/>
Where being apprehended, his false cunning<br/>
(Not meaning to partake with me in danger)<br/>
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,<br/>

Not half an hour before.

I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman;<br/>
But had it been the brother of my blood,<br/>
I must have done no less with wit and safety.<br/>
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that<br/>
I do perceive it hath offended you.<br/>
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows<br/>
We made each other but so late ago.

One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons!<br/>
A natural perspective, that is, and is not!

How have the hours rack&rsquo;d and tortur&rsquo;d me<br/>
Since I have lost thee.

Sebastian are you?

<p>SEBASTIAN.<br/>
Fear&rsquo;st thou that, Antonio?

How have you made division of yourself?<br/>
An apple cleft in two is not more twin<br/>

Most wonderful!
</p>

<p>SEBASTIAN.<br/>
Do I stand there? I never had a brother:<br/>
Nor can there be that deity in my nature<br/>
Of here and everywhere. I had a sister,<br/>
Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured.<br/>
Of charity, what kin are you to me?<br/>
What countryman? What name? What parentage?
</p>

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;<br/>
Such a Sebastian was my brother too:<br/>
So went he suited to his watery tomb.<br/>
If spirits can assume both form and suit,<br/>
You come to fright us.
</p>

<p>SEBASTIAN.<br/>
A spirit I am indeed,<br/>
But am in that dimension grossly clad,<br/>
Which from the womb I did participate.<br/>
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,<br/>
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,<br/>
And say, &lsquo;Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.&rsquo;

<p>VIOLA.<br/>
My father had a mole upon his brow.

<p>SEBASTIAN.<br/>
And so had mine.

And died that day when Viola from her birth<br/>
Had numbered thirteen years.

O, that record is lively in my soul!<br/>
He finished indeed his mortal act<br/>
That day that made my sister thirteen years.

But this my masculine usurp&rsquo;d attire,<br/>

Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump<br/>
That I am Viola; which to confirm,<br/>
I&rsquo;ll bring you to a captain in this town,<br/>
Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help<br/>
I was preserv&rsquo;d to serve this noble count.<br/>
All the occurrence of my fortune since<br/>
Hath been between this lady and this lord.

But nature to her bias drew in that.<br/>
You would have been contracted to a maid;<br/>
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived:<br/>
You are betroth&rsquo;d both to a maid and man.

Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.<br/>
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,<br/>

Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.

And all those swearings keep as true in soul<br/>

Hath my maid&rsquo;s garments. He, upon some action,<br/>
Is now in durance, at Malvolio&rsquo;s suit,<br/>
A gentleman and follower of my lady&rsquo;s.

not much when they are delivered.

not but to do myself much right or you much shame. Think of me as you please. I

Notorious wrong.

Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter.<br/>
You must not now deny it is your hand,<br/>
Write from it, if you can, in hand, or phrase,<br/>
Or say &rsquo;tis not your seal, not your invention:<br/>
You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,<br/>
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,<br/>
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,<br/>
Bade me come smiling and cross-garter&rsquo;d to you,<br/>
To put on yellow stockings, and to frown<br/>
Upon Sir Toby, and the lighter people;<br/>
And acting this in an obedient hope,<br/>
Why have you suffer&rsquo;d me to be imprison&rsquo;d,<br/>
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,<br/>
And made the most notorious geck and gull<br/>
That e&rsquo;er invention played on? Tell me why?
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,<br/>
Though I confess, much like the character:<br/>
But out of question, &rsquo;tis Maria&rsquo;s hand.<br/>
And now I do bethink me, it was she<br/>
First told me thou wast mad; then cam&rsquo;st in smiling,<br/>
And in such forms which here were presuppos&rsquo;d<br/>
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.<br/>
This practice hath most shrewdly pass&rsquo;d upon thee.<br/>
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,<br/>
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge<br/>
Of thine own cause.
</p>

<p>FABIAN.<br/>
Good madam, hear me speak,<br/>
And let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come,<br/>
Taint the condition of this present hour,<br/>
Which I have wonder&rsquo;d at. In hope it shall not,<br/>
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby<br/>
Set this device against Malvolio here,<br/>
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts<br/>
We had conceiv&rsquo;d against him. Maria writ<br/>
The letter, at Sir Toby&rsquo;s great importance,<br/>
In recompense whereof he hath married her.<br/>
How with a sportful malice it was follow&rsquo;d<br/>
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,<br/>
If that the injuries be justly weigh&rsquo;d<br/>
That have on both sides passed.
</p>

<p>OLIVIA.<br/>
Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
</p>

<p>CLOWN.<br/>
Why, &lsquo;some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have
greatness thrown upon them.&rsquo; I was one, sir, in this interlude, one Sir
Topas, sir, but that&rsquo;s all one. &lsquo;By the Lord, fool, I am not
mad.&rsquo; But do you remember? &lsquo;Madam, why laugh you at such a barren
rascal? And you smile not, he&rsquo;s gagged&rsquo;? And thus the whirligig of
time brings in his revenges.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
